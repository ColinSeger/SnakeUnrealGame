I want for apologize for low quality on this snake project.

If you would prefer the actual build I could turn that in if requested but for now you get a github link

Here is github link https://github.com/ColinSeger/SnakeUnrealGame/tree/main

Some bugs that i did not bother fixing yet.
You sometimes die when loading into map (There are layers as to why it happens)
